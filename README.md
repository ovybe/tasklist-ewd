# tasklist-ewd
- This is a tasklist which uses a database to store the categories and tasks added by the user. 
- This is a Web Design project I chose to work on. 
- This was one of my first projects, thus my vocabulary may be limited and my skills lacking, so please let me know of any issues or mistakes and I will try to fix them ASAP.
## How does it work ?
To access the site, you must create and log in with an account, which is also stored in the database.
## How do I download this?

- You can go to the code and download the main branch. 
- You will need a server to host it on.

I used XAMPP Apache and MySQL to be able to host the entire website. (The contents of the .ZIP were placed in a folder inside the htdocs folder, which is located wherever you installed XAMPP).
